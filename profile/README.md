Working in theoretical biological physics in close collaboration with experimental groups, we are
concerned with the theory and simulation of elementary biomolecular processes. In particular, we
strive to design new multiscale simulation methods and develop novel strategies to reduce the
complexity of nonequilibrium phenomena.
